# joust
Inspired by the Joust arcade game. The player controls the blue ostritch using the WASD keys. Enemy buzzards fly out of the sides of the screen when the player begins moving. The player "jousts" with the buzzards by running into them. Whichever bird is above the other wins the joust and the other bird dies. When buzzards die, they drop eggs that can be picked up by the ostrich to increase the score. If the eggs are not picked up quickly enough, the egg will hatch into a new buzzard. When all buzzards are dead, more will spawn and fly in from the sides of the screen again. The game ends when the player loses all three of their lives.
